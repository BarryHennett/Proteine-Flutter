Step 1: (POST)
Incremental counter endpoint.
Replace Hello world example endpoint to
- check if a counter exits in database
- if not set it to 0
- if it does read a counter value from the database
- increment the counter by 1
- save the counter
- return the count in the response
Step 2: (POST)
Create object with parameters.
- Parameters = Date, Name (json body)
- Do some basic checking (eg date is before now) and return error codes.
- Save the event to the database (and add some fake event data such as owner, participants)
- Return the object in the response
Step 3:
Getting objects
- Endpoint 1: get object by Id (GET)
- Endpoint 2: get list of objects (GET)
- Get request from one of the endpoints
- Query data
- Return data
- Handle ownership (ie assume user id is some_user, have some fake data owned by other_user, return error if trying to access wrong data)
Step 4:
Delete object:
- User calls /objectId (DELETE)
- Check ownership etc
Step 5:
RSVP to event
- Non owner user calls attendance endpoint (PUT)
- If they are an attendee, update just their state
- Return current event object
